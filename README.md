## Overview

**Bazel Rules for Maven Repositories** allow the specification of a list of artifacts which
constitute maven repository's universe of deps, and exposes these deps into a bazel *repository*
namespace.  The name of the repository specification rule becomes the repository name in Bazel.
For instance the following specification:
 
```python
MAVEN_REPOSITORY_RULES_VERSION = "0.1"
MAVEN_REPOSITORY_RULES_SHA = "ea4c36b5aee1cc17abac88ca5704927ef83f310126bde01eb66e993212ca555e"
http_archive(
    name = "maven_repository_rules",
    urls = ["https://github.com/israfil/bazel_maven_repository/archive/%s.zip" % MAVEN_REPOSITORY_RULES_VERSION],
    type = "zip",
    strip_prefix = "bazel_maven_repository-%s" % MAVEN_REPOSITORY_RULES_VERSION,
    sha256 = MAVEN_REPOSITORY_RULES_SHA,
)
load("@maven_repository_rules//maven:maven.bzl", "maven_repository_specification")
maven_repository_specification(
    name = "maven",
    insecure_artifacts = [
        "com.google.dagger:dagger:1.4",
    ],
    artifacts = {
        "com.google.guava:guava:25.0-jre": "3fd4341776428c7e0e5c18a7c10de129475b69ab9d30aeafbb5c277bb6074fa9",
    }
)
```
 
... results in deps of the format `@maven//com/google/guava:guava` (which can be abbreviated to 
`@maven//com/google/guava`)

Dependency versions are resolved in the single artifact list.  Only one version is permitted within
a repository.

## Coordinate Translation

Translation from maven group/artifact coordinates to bazel package/target coordinates is naive but
orderly.  The logic mirrors the layout of a maven repository, with group_id elements (separated by
`.`) turning into a package hierarchy, and the artifact_id turning into a bazel target. 

### Mangling

Bazel tends not to like package and target names using anything other than `[A-Za-z9-0_]` (though it
can support dashes in some cases).  These rules do a straight mangling of other characters into `_`
in artifact_ids (though not in group_ids because: reasons).

While this typically turns into what you'd expect, there are a few times where it doesn't. 

For instance:

```python
maven_repository_specification(
    name = "maven",
    insecure_artifacts = [
        "org.mockito:mockito-core:1.9.5",
        "joda-time:joda-time:1.1",
    ],
)
```
 
would be referenced in a rule like so:

```python
java_library(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = glob(["*.java"]),
    deps = [
        "@maven//org/mockito:mockito_core",
        "@maven//joda-time:joda_time",
    ],
)
```

> Note: The package/workspace layout generated by the `maven_repository_specification` rule can be
> found at `<workspace>/bazel-<workspace_name>/external/<maven_repo_name>` (all bazel generated
> workspaces are available in `bazel-yourworkspace/external`).  The package structure can be
> inspected if it is confusing.

## Sha verification

Artifacts with SHA headers can be added to `artifacts`, in the form:
`{ "group_id:artifact_id:version": "sha" }`. Artifacts without SHA headers should be added
to `insecure_artifacts` in the form `[ "group_id:artifact_id:version" ]`

The rules will reject artifacts without SHAs that do not go through the `insecure_artifacts`. This
only serves a documentary purpose and it is the responsibility of the project maintainer to do any
off-line validation that the SHA hashes are the properly published hashes.

## Variation

### Substitution of build targets

One can provide a `BUILD.bazel file snippet` that will be substituted for the auto-generated target
implied by a maven artifact.  This is very useful for providing an annotation-processor-exporting
alternative target.  The substitution is naive, so the string needs to be appropriate and any rules
need to be correct, contain the right dependencies, etc. 


A simple use-case would be to substitute a target name (e.g. "mockito-core" -> "mockito") for
cleaner/easier use in bazel:

```python
MOCKITO_BUILD_SNIPPET = """maven_jvm_artifact(name = "mockito", artifact = "org.mockito:mockito-core:2.20.1")"""

maven_repository_specification(
    name = "maven",
    insecure_artifacts = [
        "org.mockito:mockito-core:2.20.1",
        # ... all the other deps.
    ],
    build_substitutes = {
        "org.mockito:mockito-core": MOCKITO_BUILD_SNIPPET,
    }
)
```

This would allow the following use in a `BUILD.bazel` file.

```python
java_test(
  name = "MyTest",
  srcs = "MyTest.java",
  deps = [
    # ... other deps
    "@maven//org/mockito" # instead of "@maven//org/mockito:mockito-core"
  ],
)
```

More complex use-cases are possible, such as adding substitute targets with annotation processing `java_plugin`
targets and exports.  An example with Dagger would look like this (with the basic rule imports assumed):

```python
DAGGER_PROCESSOR_SNIPPET = """
# use this target
java_library(name = "dagger", exports = [":dagger_api"], exported_plugins = [":dagger_plugin"])

# alternatively-named import of the raw dagger library.
maven_jvm_artifact(name = "dagger_api", artifact = "com.google.dagger:dagger:2.20")

java_plugin(
    name = "dagger_plugin",
    processor_class = "dagger.internal.codegen.ComponentProcessor",
    generates_api = True,
    deps = [
        ":dagger_api", # imported above
        ":dagger_compiler", # auto-generated into the same package
        ":dagger_producers", # auto-generated into the same package
        ":dagger_spi", # auto-generated into the same package
        "@maven//com/google/code/findbugs:jsr305",
        # ... all the other deps of dagger_compiler
    ],
)
"""

maven_repository_specification(
    name = "maven",
    insecure_artifacts = [
        "com.google.dagger:dagger:2.20",
        "com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.20",
        "com.google.dagger:dagger-producers:2.20",
        "com.google.dagger:dagger-spi:2.20",
        "com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:3.0.2",
        # ... all the other deps.
    ],
    build_substitutes = {
        "com.google.dagger:dagger": DAGGER_PROCESSOR_SNIPPET,
    }
)
```

> Note: This won't build as-stated, because it's missing the extra deps dagger-compiler requires.  A more full
> (working) example can be found in [test/test_workspace/WORKSPACE](test/test_workspace/WORKSPACE).  The
> above is to illustrate the pattern.

Thereafter, any target with a dependency on (in this example) `@maven//com/google/dagger` will invoke annotation
processing and generate any dagger-generated code.  The same pattern could be used for
[Dagger](http://github.com/google/dagger), [AutoFactory and AutoValue](http://github.com/google/auto), etc.

Such snippet constants can be extracted into .bzl files and imported to keep the WORKSPACE file tidy. In the
future some standard templates may be offered by this project, but not until deps validation is available, as
it would be too easy to have templates' deps lists go out of date as versions bumped, if no other validation
prevented it or notified about it.

### Packaging

Optionally, an artifact may specify a packaging. Valid artifact coordinates are listable this way:
`"group_id:artifact_id:version[:packaging]"`

At present, only `jar` (default) and `aar` packaging are supported.

### Classifiers

Classifiers have only limited support. An artifact can specify a classifier, but only that or
the unclassified artifact can be used, but not both.

Classifiers are tacked on the end, e.g. `"foo.bar:blah:1.0:jar:some-classifier"`
 
## Limitations

This doesn't recreate the dependencies between maven artifacts within the generated bazel rules.
Future versions may support this, as well as validation that your artifact list is complete to
satisfy all its dependencies.  For now, the generated bazel targets will not include any transitive
dependency closure (unless replaced by a substitution snippet).

## Other Usage Notes

Because of the nature of bazel repository/workspace operation, updating the list of artifacts may
invalidate build caches, and force a re-run of workspace operations (and possibly reduce
incrementality of the next build).  This is unavoidable.

It may make sense, if one's maven universe gets big, to extract the list of artifacts into a 
constant in a separate file (e.g. `maven_artifacts.bzl`) and import it.
